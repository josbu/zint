Build a Win32 "zint.dll" using MS Visual Studio 6.0 (VC6).

$ZR is the zint root folder (this file is in $ZR\win32\zint_dll_vc6)

Follow the instructions for setting up "$ZR\..\zlib" and "$ZR\..\lpng"
as given in "$ZR\win32\zint_cmdline_vc6\README.txt".

(Note that the GS1 Syntax Engine is not compilable with VC6.)

Open "zint_dll_vc6.dsw" in this folder with the VC6 GUI and build.
